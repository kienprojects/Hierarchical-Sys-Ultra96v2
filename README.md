# A Novel Hierarchical Embedded System for Detection and Diagnosis of COPD and Other Respiratory Disorders

This repo is the PyTorch code of our paper: [links]

**Highlight**
   1. A proposed hierarchical embedded system using Random Forest and Lightweight CNN models with four resilient layers that achieve 98,81\% accuracy reach state-of-the-art results compared to other basic Machine Learning methods. Moreover, unlike previous methods that used static models, fixed parameters, and set-up conditions, this dynamic embedded system with high flexibility could complete the classification without completing four stages. It could be modified to adapt to various conditions of the dataset.
   2. Implement the proposed model on soft-hard system FPGA Ultra96V2 using PYNQ and Vitis-AI framework that works in real-time conditions and achieves impressive 52.5\% power saving and outperformance with excellent GOPs compared to traditional CPU-GPU methods.
   3. We propose a novel Domain-Specific Quantization Strategy (DSQS) tailored specifically for respiratory sound analysis on FPGA platforms.
